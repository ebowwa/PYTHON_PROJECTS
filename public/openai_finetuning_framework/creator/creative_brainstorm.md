"I aim to develop a pipeline for generating a series of datasets with the objective of creating a compact, highly efficient dataset for training a general large language model. I intend to incorporate prompts into this process. The code will be linked to an API that generates completions. We will designate system prompts and record the API's responses. To achieve this, we require a structured approach and will store everything in a CSV file. The structure will include `x`, `y`, `z`, where `x` represents a markdown file located in the `prompts` subdirectory, `y` denotes a completion response, and `z` signifies the combined completion response of `x` and `y`."

```python
import csv

def save_to_csv(file_name, data):
    with open(file_name, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csv_file:
        fieldnames = ['x', 'y', 'z']
        writer = csv.DictWriter(csv_file, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()
        for item in data:
            writer.writerow(item)

# Example usage:
data = [
    {"x": "markdown_file_1.md", "y": "completion_1", "z": "combined_completion_1"},
    {"x": "markdown_file_2.md", "y": "completion_2", "z": "combined_completion_2"}
]
save_to_csv('dataset.csv', data)
```
